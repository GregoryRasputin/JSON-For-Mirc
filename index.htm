<h1>About</h1>
<p>
    JSON For mIRC is a mIRC script that makes use of mIRC's COM interface to parse, access, and manipulate <a href="./doc/whatisjson.htm">JSON data</a>. Boasting a rich feature set, JSON For mIRC aims to be comprehensive and light-weight.<br>
    <br>

    <h4>History</h4>
    After scouring the web for a well coded JSON parser, a script by Timi was discovered that made use of mIRC's COM interferace. Though Timi's JSON parser was functional and fast (compared to other pure mSL implementations) it was found to have many inefficiencies. SReject began to write his own version and JSON For mIRC was born.
    <br><br>
    The first release brought parsing and accessing but due to poor planning and being built from a piecemeal of personal specialized scripts, the original release had many flaws. As bugs were patched the codebase became harder to manage resulting in an ever increasing difficulty to patch newly discovered bugs or add desired features. While the project struggled to maintain itself new features were added to mIRC and many coding discoveries were made. This gave rise to a complete rewrite for the version 2 series(v2).
    <br><br>
    v2 is maintained with a far stricter set of coding guidelines, is open sourced and is version controlled via <a href="https://github.com/SReject/JSON-For-Mirc" target="_blank">git/github</a>. v2 not only reimplements the functionality of the first release but aims to add manipulation so JSON can be used as a fully functional data store.
