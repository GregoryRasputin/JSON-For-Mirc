    <header><h1>What is JSON?</h1></header>
    <div class="body">
        <p>JSON is short for "JavaScript Object Notation"; originally meant for web applications, it has become the go-to data format for many enviornments and platforms. Its structuring makes for small, text-based, outputs that are easily parsable programmatically while still being human legiable.</p>
        <p>JSON is NOT a functional data notation. JSON data does not have a means to specify directives(commands) a program must do when attempting to understand the JSON data; the JSON standard strictly prohibits such as a means of ensuring security.</p>

<article id="whitespace">
    <header><h1>Whitespace</h1></header>
    <div class="body">
        <p>Previously it was mentioned that JSON is human readable yet most web api's return it as a jumbled mess. This is because JSON intrepreters are required to ignore whitespace so it can be removed without costing data integrity; this is what those APIs do with the intent of reducing network traffic.</p>
        <p>There are <a href="http://jsonviewer.stack.hu/" target="_blank">online tools</a> that will re-add whitespace to make the output human readable.</p>

    <header><h1>Primitives</h1></header>
    <div class="body">
        <p>JSON has four primitive data types to represent simple values. These data types do not have the complexity or structuring to contain multiple values the way Container Types do.</p>
        <section class="sub" id="datatypes/primitives/null">
            <div>
                <h3>Null</h3> - <span class="small">Denoted by the keyword <code>null</code></span>
            </div>
            <div class="body smaller">
                <p>Null is used when there is absolutely no value to reference. That is, the value isn't empty text or 0 or false; there is absolutely nothing to reference.</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section class="sub" id="datatypes/primitives/boolean">
            <div>
                <h3>Boolean</h3> - <span class="smaller">Denoted by the keywords <code>true</code> or <code>false</code></span>
            </div>
            <div class="body smaller">
                <p>Boolean is used when a value is meant to only have two states. Its used to say yes, true, on, no, false, or off</p>

            </div>
            <div class="body smaller">
                <p>Number is used when a value should be intrepreted as a number. Positive numbers, negitive numbers and decimals are all Number data types.</p>

            <div class="body smaller">
                <p>String is used when a value, regardless of its contents should be intrepreted as text.</p>
                <p>Due to strings being able to contain any text, including double quotes, there are special character sequences that have alternative meanings within the context of a string:</p>
                <ul class="simple">
                    <li><code>\"</code> - Represents a double quote</li>

                    <li><code>\\</code> - Represents a back slash</li>
                    <li><code>\f</code> - Represents a form-feed character</li>
                    <li><code>\b</code> - Represents a back-space character</li>
                    <li><code>\r</code> - Represents a carriage return character</li>
                    <li><code>\n</code> - Represents a line-feed character</li>
                    <li><code>\t</code> - Represents a tab character</li>
                    <li><code>\uNNNN</code> - Represents a unicode character where <code>NNNN</code> is the hexidecimal code point.</li>

                <p>Objects are unordered lists where each value contained within is referenced by a given key.

Keys are case sensitive so attempting to reference "KEY" will not point to the data contained under "key".</p>
